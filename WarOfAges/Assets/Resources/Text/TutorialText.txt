Here is the shop. You can view info about each <b>unit</b> by hovering or holding on its image. Let's learn how to spawn a unit now. First, you select a unit in the shop. Most units are either a troop or building, but there are exceptions...
This unit is a troop. You can view its info in the <b>info bar</b> on the right. You can spawn troops only on territory adjacent to a building. Your base is a building. Let's spawn your first troop!
The tiles you can't spawn on will also be signified by being shaded.
