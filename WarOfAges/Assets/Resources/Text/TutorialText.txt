Welcome, player! To begin our game, we need to give our <b>base</b> a starting position.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Click on any exposed <b>tile</b> to place our base there, as long as it is a green tile. Tiles are either <b>water</b> (blue) or <b>land</b> (green).

The highlighted tiles are our <b>territory</b>. We will learn about expanding our territory later.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Here in the player info tab, we can find information about each player. We can find how much gold and territory they each have, and how many troops and buildings they each have. We can also see which <b>age</b> they are in.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

This is how much gold we have. The number beside it is the <b>income</b> we will receive after every <b>turn</b>. Our income depends on how many land tiles are within our territory.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Now let's end our turn, by clicking this End Turn button. Notice as our gold increases!

Now that we have more gold, we can head over to the shop and spawn in a <b>unit</b>. Units can be either a <b>troop</b>, a <b>building</b>, or a <b>spell</b>.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

We can view a unit's stats if we select it. You may also simply hover over it in the shop to view its description.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Now, select the first unit. This is a troop.

To spawn this troop, we must do so on land territory adjacent to a building. Since our base is a building, let's place our troop on an adjacent land tile.

Great! Our troop will spawn when the turn ends. Click away to stop placing troops.

If we no longer want to spawn a troop, we can click on it and despawn it for a full refund. However, once a troop spawns, you may only sell it for half its original price.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Let's end our turn again. Our troop will then spawn onto the map!

Now that we have a troop, we can use it to claim more territory. A tile becomes our territory once a troop moves onto it.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

To move our troop, simply click on it and then click on a destination. This can be an adjacent tile, a far-away tile, or even another troop. For now, pick an adjacent land tile outside our territory.

The red arrow indicates where the troop plans to move on its next turn. To cancel, simply set its destination to the tile it is already on.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Let's just end our turn to see it move!

Great! We have a new piece of territory, and our income has increased.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

We always start off in the Stone Age. As a result, all the <b>units</b> in our shop will belong to the Stone Age.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Once we have enough gold, we can advance to the next age! This will <b>upgrade</b> all units in the shop to a stronger version, but they will cost more gold.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue. 

Note that units on your map do not advance with the ages. We will need to click on it and manually upgrade it with gold.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

When advancing to a new age, we are allowed to unlock a new type of unit! We entered the Stone Age when we started the game, so we have actually had a free unit unlock since the game began! Let's unlock the third unit, the ship type. 

Go ahead and spawn a ship on a water tile within your territory. The ship can be moved along water and carries troops.

You may try out its mechanics throughout this tutorial (move our troop onto the ship then move the ship).<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

As the game progresses, you will have to learn how each unit works and where they may be placed. I can't hold your hand forever.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

And as you explore the map, you will inevitably encounter other players.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

You will have to overtake their territory, eliminate their troops and buildings, and ultimately destroy their base while keeping your own safe.<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

If your base is still standing when every other player's base is destroyed, you will have won the game!<br><br>Click anywhere to continue.

Best of luck!<br><br>Click to exit tutorial.
