Welcome! Begin your game by placing your <b>base</b> on a visible tile on the map.
The highlighted area is your territory. This can be water or land, but only land generates revenue after every turn.
Select this unit in the shop. Most units are either a troop or building, but there are exceptions...
This unit is a troop. Let’s spawn him on land someplace in your territory next to your base. 
You can only spawn troops on land in your territory that are adjacent to a building.
Let’s press the End Turn button. When all players have done so, troops will spawn, move, and attack in this order. 
It’s your turn again now. During each turn, you may spawn units as well as move troops.
Let’s select the melee troop you placed on the map. Click on the tile to it to direct it there.
End your turn. Troops can move to any adjacent tile as long as it is land. Your territory now includes that tile. 
Every time you claim a piece of land, you earn gold. You previously spent gold to spawn your melee troop.
Let’s click on the troop again to select it. Selecting a unit lets you check on its health as well as perform actions on it. 
You may sell a unit for some gold or upgrade them up to the next age, provided you are in it or have been in it.  
You are currently in the Stone Age, but you have enough gold to advance!Before you advance, you can unlock a unit of your choosing early!
Now, let’s advance our age! When you advance, troops will get stronger but also cost more. Land will also generate more gold.
Note that units on your map do not advance with the ages. If you wish, you may upgrade them to match the new age.
Now that you’ve advanced into a new age, you can unlock a new unit of your choice! For the purposes of this tutorial, we will unlock an [EXTRA MONEY].
Let’s place an [EXTRA MONEY] somewhere in your territory. This can be on any land tile as long as it is your territory.
